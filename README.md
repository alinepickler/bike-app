# Biking

## Synopsis

This is a conceptual project of a bicycle short-term rent service created to integrate ReactJS and Google Maps.

## Interface

The interface style is not applied yet. It's possible to visualize its prototype on my [Portfolio page](https://alinepickler.github.io/web.html#biking-row).

## Requirements

Add your Google Maps Key to app/components/GoogleMapsKey.js (don't worry, it's set to be ignored by .gitignore):

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const GoogleMapsKey = 'YOUR-KEY';

export default GoogleMapsKey;
```

Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). Then execute the following in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```
